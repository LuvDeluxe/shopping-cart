# shopping-cart
 
A dynamic shopping cart project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add products to their cart, adjust quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout. The project utilizes local storage to persist the cart data in the browser, allowing users to revisit the site and retain their cart contents. This project aims to demonstrate frontend development skills and provide hands-on experience with building interactive web applications.
